## Pull Requests

- **[PSR-12 Coding Standard.](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12)** The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **Add tests!** Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour.** Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle.** We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **Create feature branches.** Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- **One pull request per feature.** If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history.** Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commdroneraisingit-Messages) before submitting.

*Happy coding!*
